## Personal Blog - Essays and Reflections
This repository contains the source code for my personal blog, a space dedicated to long-form writing and quiet observation. The blog is built around reflective essays that explore people, power, ambition, ego, empathy, and the subtle contradictions we encounter while growing up.

Rather than offering advice or conclusions, the writing focuses on noticing patterns—how individuals behave, how success is distributed, and how our early ideals often clash with lived reality. The goal is not self-help or motivation, but understanding.
