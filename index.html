                We always know that one friend who behaves like they are going through a lot emotionally, and then we always have this another friend who behaves like they are on this planet to save others from emotional trauma.
<br/>
Both of these kind of people need to realise they do not have to give so many fucks about things which do not matter. Let's talk about the victims first, because I myself behave like one sometimes. So the victims have this favorite behaviour and that behaviour is to not take responsibility of their own shit. These guys never agree in their entire lives that the problems they are dealing with are because of their own shenanigans. They will always have a person to blame. It is like sitting on the toilet seat and saying your shit does not smell because of you. Such people are so much used to attention given by their friends and family that they will go to extremes just to prove that they are correct and everything shitty in their lives is because of something else, which they do not take responsibility for.

<br/>
                <br/>
And then there are the savers, they think that they are all Mother Teresa or an incarnation of some very holy man. These mates go to superficial extents just to prove that they are the problem, and they are responsible for other people's problems as well. These are the adults who matured at the age of 10 and started behaving like the very caretakers of their own parents. Some people call it reverse-parenting. It is often perceived as childhood trauma by psychologists. When the parents are going through hardships in one's childhood, they start taking care of their own parents emotionally, putting up that fake smile, and always ready to support anyone emotionally, never asking for anything, just working day and night for other people's problems as it validates survival for them.
<br/>
                <br/>
Here I am not saying that you should not help other people, but there is a difference between helping and taking responsibility of another person's shit as if you messed up is totally wrong. There are some situations when all you need to do is ignore and move on.
<br/>
To conclude I'd say that, we all have personalities, our own characteristics, we all have a saver and a victim within ourselves, me too! All we can do is realise that what matters the most is only to give a fuck about things which are important for us and take responsibility of our own shit. As we start taking responsibility of our own shit, we'd realise that most of our mental health crisis can be solved very easily.

              why that narcissist friend of yours will actually win in life
            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p class="post-excerpt">
                Growing up is strange. You admire people who behave properly,
                who know how to present themselves, carry themselves out there
                in the world, and you try your best to be the most well behaved
                person with virtues and manners.
                <br />
                This was the case for me, I was that kid who had these
                aspirations of becoming the very well mannered person I knew.
                And then on one strange day, you realise that the kid who
                bullied you back in high school is actually doing amazing
                things, the friend of yours who used to say shit about other
                people is pulling interns from companies in the united states,
                and then for a while you realise that your whole life was a lie!

                people is pulling interns from companies in the united states,
                and then for a while you realise that your whole life was a lie!
                <br />
                <br />
                What happened to that tendency of yours to behave like a servant
                from one of those soaps from 1990s?
                <br />
                The truth is that all those etiquettes, yet they were important,
                were not the very traits needed for you to get rich, which for
                some people like me, is one of the parameters of success (at
                least right now).
                <br />
                The fact with narcissists is that even though they think and
                obsess over themselves and almost end up in jail at a lot of
                times, they are really good at not paying attention to every
                single unimportant thing in life.
                <br />
                On the random day you are writing a blog to document your own
                life's experience they are working on something they really
                obsess over and think would get them somewhere ahead of the
                person they hate (in some cases, that could be me).
                <br />
                Narcissists are selfish creatures, they are not really loved in
                their own personal circle, yet they can be really influential to
                people around the world, all they think of is of themselves, and
                even if you hate them, you know that they are just people with
                no emotional intelligence whatsoever, you will end up admiring
                them.
                <br />
                <br />
                So should I say that it is better to be a selfish irritating
                narcissist than rather be an empathetic person who cares about
                other people's lives and feeling the whole time?
                <br />
                No, absolutely not, since even though they seem cool in movies
                firing employees without thinking about the fact that the guy
                has kids to feed at home, a lot of such people never do anything
                huge in their life.
                <br />
                Those wealthy entrepreneurs and businessmen are just a very
                small percentage of narcissists who make it far in life, rest of
                them?
                <br />
                They obsess so much over themselves that they end up creating a
                bubble of their own life and their own success in their minds
                which no one except them gives a fuck about on the entire
                planet.
                <br />
                And to validate this kind of behaviour that these people carry
                around themselves they make others feel bad about themselves,
                and in reality, they live pretty fucked up lives inside their
                own brain chasing superiority over others in one form or another
                their whole lives.
                <br />
                <br />
                So why do I say that the narcissist friend of yours will
                actually succeed in life?
                <br />
                Well that is because if this friend of yours will chase
                superiority over others through hard work, determination and
                discipline, there is a huge possibility that they might end up
                becoming pretty fucking big of a deal, similar to the one they
                are in their mind right now.

                <br />
                To draw up a conclusion I might say that we should all have some
                narcissistic qualities in ourselves, should'nt we?
